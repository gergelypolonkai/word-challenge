100(ish) words challenge
========================

This is the main project for 100(ish)word challenge, a challenge for
artists of different kinds.

The goal of the site is to present a word for the users every day, and
let them create something based on that word, within a given time
limit. They can then share their work via the site, so other users can
vote for it (if it represents the word by any means).

The project aims to run on Heroku, but testing is done for both Python
2.7 (because of Heroku) and Python 3.4 (because we can).
